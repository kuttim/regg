Hi! This is a project that shares as much code as possible between web, mobile and desktop applications.
Like the idea behind it? Considering collaborating or just being a stargazer.




## Development setup

### I highly recommend using yarn instead of npm that way you can ensure you don't run into issues since the project is using yarn lock files. The development setup to get this running is quite simple.
- To install project dependencies `yarn install`
- Run web UI `yarn run web:dev`
- Run desktop UI `yarn run desktop:dev`
- Run mobile UI `yarn run mobile:dev`
- Clean project `yarn clean`

## Credits

### This project is heavily inspired by [React native web](https://github.com/brunolemos/react-native-web-monorepo) repository.
